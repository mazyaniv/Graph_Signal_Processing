# DOA using GSP theorem
Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation plays a pivotal
role in array processing and radar technology, with ongoing dis-
cussions centered around the utilization of mixed-resolution data
incorporating both analog and 1-bit quantized measurements.
Investigating the impact of varying the number of low-resolution
measurements on different analytic algorithms aims to uncover
methods for effectively leveraging both low and high-resolution
sensors, enhancing DOA estimation in mixed-resolution array
cases. Concurrently, DOA estimation, supported by graph signal
processing, introduces innovative methodologies for discerning
arrival directions across various applications. This work delves
into the utilization of graph-based approaches to address this
challenge, juxtaposing them against established methods such
as the MUSIC algorithm. Specifically, a multi-objective DOA
methodology is explored, leveraging a fully connected graph to
emulate sensor connectivity. Simulation outcomes validate the
efficacy of graph-based solutions, closely aligning with conven-
tional approaches and highlighting their potential in resolving
this pertinent issue.
